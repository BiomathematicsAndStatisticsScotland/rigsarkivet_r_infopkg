Description: This package is an aid to those submitting information
   packages to the Danish National Archives (RigsArkivet). The tool
   creates information packages from statistical data (R data frames)
   that aim to be compliant with Executive Order 128 Annex 9. These
   packages may then be tested with the Danish National Archives
   "ASTA" tool and submitted to the archive. To operate this tool you
   require an information package identifier, archiveIndex.xml file
   and contextDocumentationIndex.xml file. All may be obtained from
   the National Archives.
